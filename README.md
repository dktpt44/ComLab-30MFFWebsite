## Built With

## Process

I had the wireframe ready. First I put up all the content using html only. Then I styled all the elements with CSS. Then came Javascript. I used JS for the image carousel and for the side navigation.

## Future Updates

- [ ] Add more user interactivity aspects

## Reflection

It was a great experience to built this website. I enjoyed it very much. There were times where I was fraustated by errors that were hard to debug, especially when building the image carousel, but at the end everything worked out correctly. It gives a great pleasure when I debug something and finally have the code running as expected.
